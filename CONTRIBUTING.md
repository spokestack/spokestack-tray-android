## Deploying
https://github.com/nebula-plugins/nebula-release-plugin
https://github.com/nebula-plugins/nebula-publishing-plugin


1. Add the following to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```text
signing.keyId=XXXXXXXX
signing.password=<key password, if one exists>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/me/.gnupg/secring.gpg
centralUsername=<sonatype username>
centralPassword=<sonatype password>
```

1. Start a new branch for your release. Name it according to the release's semantic version number: `v#.#.#`.
1. Run `./gradlew final`. This will create a git tag and push it to GitHub.
  * By default, `final` increments the minor version in the project's semantic version.
  * To bump the major or patch version: `./gradlew final -Prelease.scope=(major|patch)]`.
1. Run `./gradlew publish -Prelease.useLastTag=true`. This uploads artifacts to a staging repository to be synced with Maven Central.
1. PR your release branch on GitHub.
1. Add release notes for the tag on GitHub.
